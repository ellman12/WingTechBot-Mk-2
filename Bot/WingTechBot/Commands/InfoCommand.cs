WingTech Bot is used for various actions, like tracking reactions, calculating karma, and other silly shenanigans and antics.
### Reaction Tracking and Karma
WingTech Bot will track every reaction added to every message sent after the cutoff date (which is `{Bot.Config.StartDate:s}`). Any reactions added to or removed from messages sent before then are ignored. WTB will only track built-in emojis like ðŸ¤“ and emotes part of this server (like upvote/downvote, and the awards).

Karma is calculated based on the amount of reactions you receive with the upvote and downvote emotes. Giving yourself up/down votes will be ignored and you will be scolded for doing so.
